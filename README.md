# Arduino-PRO-Portenta-C33 Demo
Arduino sketch example demonstrating connection of an [Arduino PRO Portenta C33](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/portenta-c33) to IoTConnect on AWS via Wi-Fi.  The sketch publishes a random simulated temperature measurement plus the current UTC time (acquired via online NTP servers) at 1 minute intervals.  Commands sent from IoTConnect to the Portenta C33 are also received and printed to the serial monitor illustrating full bidirectional MQTT communication.

# Portenta C33 Features
The Portenta C33 is a powerful System-on-Module based on the R7FA6M5BH2CBG microcontroller, which utilizes the high-performance Arm速 Cortex速-M33 core. The Portenta C33 shares the same form factor as the Portenta H7, and it is backward compatible with it. The Portenta C33 is fully compatible with all Portenta family shields and carriers through its MKR-styled and High-Density connectors.

The board also supports MicroPython and other high-level programming languages, allowing developers to write code in a familiar language and accelerate development. With its onboard Wi-Fi速 and Bluetooth速 connectivity, the Portenta C33 is the ideal solution for Internet of Things (IoT) gateways, remote control systems, fleet management, and process tracking. These features allow the Portenta C33 to connect easily to other devices and sensors, enabling seamless data transfer and real-time control in various applications.  Using the onboard secure element, Avnet is able to provide security management services for deployments at scale.

# Security & Authentication
Security and authentication are based on an X.509 certificate inserted into the "arduino_secrets.h" file.  Note that all sensitive information (SSIDs, passwords, topics, device keys, and certificates) are placed in "arduino_secrets.h" where each is preceded by "SECRET_xxxx" which is an Arduino method of allowing files to be shared while protecting sensitive information.  Refer to [this document](https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/tutorials/store-your-sensitive-data-safely-when-sharing) for details.

# Getting Started
Once your prerequisites are satisfied you will need to create a virtual device on IoTConnect.  Each virtual device is based on a 'template' which is a self-contained file that defines the message protocol, attributes, commands, and authentication method.  A high level outline of the required steps is as follows:
1. In IoTConnect create a device template.  
2. In IoTConnect create a virtual device based on the template .
3. IoTConnect will create a device certificate & key which, when downloaded to your C33, uniquely identify your device to IoTConnect and enable encrypted communications.
4. Complete the 'arduino_secrets.h' file with information from your virtual device (along with your Wi-Fi network parameters).
5. Compile and download the demo code to the C33

# Creating a Device Template
1. From the IoTConnect main screen, click on the 'Devices' icon which looks like an IC, then click on 'Device'

5.  Click on the **'Connection Info'** text below the red **'Disconnected** icon and proceed to the next section

 ![image](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-arduino-pro-portenta-c33-demo/assets/49933990/046ac427-7543-4c3b-b27d-e5d68f664d34)



# Copy Device Information
So far we have obtained a device template and with it, we created a virtual device on IoTConnect.  The virtual device contains information that your actual device will use to communicate with IoTConnect.  Let's get that information and place it into your local Portenta C33 file called '**arduino_secrets.h**

1.  When you clicked on 'Connection Info' in the previous step, a window opened containing vital information for your device to connect to IoTConnect.  Notice that field **names** are on the left preceeded by a '#' and the **'values** are on the right.

![image](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-arduino-pro-portenta-c33-demo/assets/49933990/cf91de64-23c6-4943-b477-766394bea9fc)


2.  Copy the following information from this IoTConnect **Connection Info** window into your **arduino_secrets.h** file.  Copy the text by clicking on the **copy** icon:
     - Copy the **#host** value and paste into your local **arduino_secrets.h** file in the **SECRET_BROKER** value
     - Copy the **#clientID** value and paste into your local **arduino_secrets.h** file in the **SECRET_CLIENT_ID** value
     - Copy the **#reporting** value and paste into your local **arduino_secrets.h** file in the **SECRET_TOPIC** value
     - Copy the **#acknowledgement** value and paste into your local **arduino_secrets.h** file in the **SECRET_ACK_TOPIC** value
     - Copy the **#cloudToDevice** value and paste into your local **arduino_secrets.h** file in the **SECRET_CMD_TOPIC** value
  
 A section of your **arduino_secrets.h** file should resemble the the one shown here:

 3.  Go back to the **Connection Info** window and click on the download certificates icon in the upper right.  This will download a zip file containing the device certificate and private key to your PC in the default download directory.  You may close the IoTConnect **Connection Info** window at this point.  The certificate & key you just downloaded allow IoTConnect to authenticate your C33.  The contents of the zip file are as shown.  Yours may differ slightly:

![image](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-arduino-pro-portenta-c33-demo/assets/49933990/53564fea-b8d2-4b20-967c-cf04b36e3024)


Unzip the files into a local directory. We will go back to them shortly. 

 4.  For added security, your C33 should authenticate IoTConnect to ensure it is not communicating with an imposter.  To enable that, you will need an AWS root CA certificate (as this version of IoTConnect is on AWS).  You can find that root CA [HERE](https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/SFSRootCAG2.pem) which opens another window (or tab) in your browser with text like this:

![image](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-arduino-pro-portenta-c33-demo/assets/49933990/a2787a33-a869-467d-81ba-a785e87dcfcc)

Select all of the text (Windows users can use **Ctrl A**) and copy it (**Ctrl C**)


![image](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-arduino-pro-portenta-c33-demo/assets/49933990/49505712-c465-4f52-b3dc-2079d40b62f8)


Go to your local **arduino_secrets.h** file and move your cursor to line 15.  Highlight the text "Insert AWS RooT CA here" and paste **(Ctrl V)** the copied text in its place.  It should look like this:


![image](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-arduino-pro-portenta-c33-demo/assets/49933990/85cb5083-f9eb-4f4b-9ec6-0b421c58af98)


 5.  Okay, we are almost there.  Going back to the 2 files you unzipped in step 3:
- cert_MyPortentaDemo.crt  (device certificate)
- pk_MyPortentaDemo.pem    (private key)

You next step is to open each of these files in a word editor (I use Notepad.exe).  You will copy the entire contents and paste it into your local **arduino_secrets.h** file just like you did with the AWS Root CA.

Let's start with **cert_MyPortentaDemo.crt**.  Open **Notepad** then drag the **cert_MyPortentaDemo.crt** icon into the Notepad window.  The text should almost exactly like the AWS Root CA text. 
- In Notepad, select all of the text using **Ctrl A** then copy it using **Ctrl C**
- Navigate to your local **arduino_secrets.h** file line 21
- Highlight the text **"Insert Device Cert here"** and paste the copied text using **Ctrl V**


You will do the same with **pk_MyPortentaDemo.pem**.  Open **Notepad** then drag the **pk_MyPortentaDemo.pem** icon into the Notepad window.
- In Notepad, select all of the text using **Ctrl A** then copy it using **Ctrl C**
- Navigate to your local **arduino_secrets.h** file line 18
- Highlight the text **"Insert Key here"** and paste the copied text using **Ctrl V**

# Enter Your Wi-Fi Details
In your local **arduino_secrets.h** file, enter the SSID of your Wi-Fi network in between the quotes for **SECRET_SSID** (line 2).

Next, enter your Wi-Fi password in between the quotes for **SECRET_PASS**

**SAVE YOUR arduino_secrets FILE !!!**
